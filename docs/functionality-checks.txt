Before opening a pull request, make sure the following commands still run without errors:

mocha -r esm

==> This runs our test suite. If any tests fail, whereas they were working before, you should continue testing
and debugging to make sure the test case was written correctly and/or your code is working correctly. Otherwise,
remaining failed tests MUST be documented in the pull request specifying WHAT the issue is and WHY it hasn't been
fixed yet.

node ./src/server

==> Currently, this is the script that starts our test server. It should remain set up so that we can debug quickly.
The functionality of this command realistically shouldn't change unless you edit the server.js file directly, but
just try to quickly ensure that your console prints an error-free response: 'listening on port:4567'. Again, if
any changes which aren't resolved confound this command, document WHAT the problem is and WHY it couldn't be fixed.

Please follow the above checks when making a pull request. It is critical that the master branch remains functional
so that we can all build off of it or jump backwards to a working version if necessary. In exceptional cases, you
may open a pull request without the above commands working, but please follow the instructions above in each case.
